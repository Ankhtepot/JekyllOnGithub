### Checkboxes:
- [x] checkbox "- [x]"
- [ ] empty checkbox " - [ ]"
+ [x] "+ [x]" also creates checkbox, but when after "- [x]" then you see empty line in between

### Media:

##### Images
![title](catHead.png "alt text")  - !\[title](source) makes images  
- Difference between link and image is "!" at the beginning.
- "blabla" behind link, but inside parenthesis ads alt text - (<link> "blabla")

##### Video
[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/x1MPkV9EFGM/default.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1MPkV9EFGM)   
thumbnail over video: syntax: "[!\[]\(thumbnail source)]\(video link)" .

### Line formatting:

>"You said **blablabla**, means quote starts with > "

~~Two Tildas around are scratching the text~~

**two stars around text means bold**  
*one star around text means italic*
 
_one underscore around text means italic_  
__double underscore around text means bold__

##### Lists

- ordered list starts with dash and space
- next line is the same     
   - nested line starts with 3 spaces and "- "
   - next nested list line
   
next line ads to last line in a list

to stop list there needs to be a empty line

+ also + starts unordered list
- this line starts with - on new line but change in a mark creates line between

* asterix is next mark to - and + to start unordered list

1. ordered list starts with number and dot (1.)
2. next line just continues the list
123. this line starts with 123 but shows 3 - order of numbers dosnt matter
5. this line starts with 5 in a file, but shows 4, because order of numbers dosnt matter
   6. nested line starts with 3 spaces and number
   456. next nested line (in file starts with 456.)
